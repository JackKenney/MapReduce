# MapReduce

This set of programs, prompted by my professor Gerome Miklau at the University of Massachusetts Amherst is in response to the extra credit portion of the assignment that involved MapReduce.
All viewable in the PDF for descriptions.

My work was written and run in compatability with Python 2.7.12 using MRJob.
