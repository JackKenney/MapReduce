# MapReduce

This set of programs, prompted by my professor Gerome Miklau at the University of Massachusetts Amherst is in response to the extra credit portion of the assignment (HW11) that involved MapReduce.
All viewable in the PDF for descriptions.

My work was written and run in compatability with Python 2.7.12 using MRJob.

The comments in each of the python files are self-explanatory, 
and inside each .py file are notes about which files to exectute with each of the programs.

For 2A I needed a stepper to run two reductions, but for the other two I was able to write a single map-reduce step. All the files that are run are the csv files. 

The #-out.txt files are the ouputs my computer generated (copied and pasted, nope not piped through cat or echo). For 2A I wrote the files to berun with both temp.csv and temp2.csv, so that is specified in this output file.

Overall I thought this was a worthwile experience, and gave me more insight into Python, a language I have not learned yet.
